# calculate_sunspot_ratio

To execute the code, ensure you've installed the required packages, such as NumPy and OpenCV.

The ratio is determined by applying k-means clustering algorithm for image segmentation. This process effectively divides the given sunspot image into three distinct regions: the umbra, penumbra, and the sun's surface.

To calculate the ratio of umbra and penumbra, 
1. Obtain a clear image of the sunspot.
2. Remove background from the image.
